*Javascript: 
-it is use to add functionality into webpage or webapp.
-it is interpreted language.
-it is loosely types language.


*how many ways we can use Javascript
1.internal Javascript: in this ,in html filw we use script yag and in that we write Javascript code
2.External Javascript:in thus we crteatea sepreate js file and that js file we import in html file head part script.

*How to display output in js 
1.document.write(): it will display output on browser.
2.window.alert(): it will generate one popup and display output in it.
3.console.log():it will display output in browser console.
4.DOM(Document Object Model):


Note: in Javascript window is global object 

*Variable:-it is container which store data in it.
          -store data can be change to reuse it.
          -in js we can create Variable with var ,let and const keyword.

syntax:     var variableName;   // variable declaration;
            variableName = value; // variable initialization;
              or 
            var variableName = value; // defining a variable   

*Rule For creating Variable 
-its name can not be any reserved keyword.
-variable name can not start with digit.
-variable name must start with lowercase letter.
-in Javascript variable name can start with $ and _ 

*Data type: 
*Looping Statment: to repeate same thing multiple time 
1.for loop: in this if condition is true then and only then innner code will execute.
  syntax: for(initialization;condition-check;increment/decrement){
       //logical code
  }
2.while loop:in this if condition is true then and only then innner code will execute.
   syntax:   initialization
    while(condition-check){
          //logical code;
         increment/decrement
     }
3.do while loop: in this even if condition is false then also code execute once.
syntax:  initialization;
        do{
            //logical code 
             increment/decrement
        }while(condition-check)



Task1: print 1,2,3.........20
Task2: print 1
            2
            3
            .
            .
            10
Task3: print 2,4,6....20

*Conditional: 
-if you want to execute code conditionaly for that we use it. 

1.if : this is condition is then and only then if block will execute 
2.if ..else: in this condition is true then if block will execute other else will execute
3.nested if lese : in this we can use if else inside another if else.
4.if ladder: 
5.swichcase :

*differance between == and === operators 
==  : it check only values and if it is same then return true value.
ex: 5==5 =>true
ex: 5=='5' =>true

=== : it check both value as well as datatype and if both are same then it reutn value.
5===5 =>true
5==='5' =>false

Q.why Javascript is called as loosely typed language.
-when we create a avariable in Javascript we can not determine what type type of data it contain.
untill and unless we initialize it.

Looping :it is use to repeate same thing multiple time. 
1.for loop 
2.while loop 
3.do while 

*Array:
-it is use to store multiple values with same data type.
-in array data store on index basis.
-array index always start from zero 
-array represented by []
-we can access array data outside array by writting arrayName[index]

*nested loop 
*function:-function is block of code which use to perform specific task.
          -function will execute only when we call it.
          -it can be reuse multiple time.

*Mainly we have two types of function
-Predefine function : function which is already developed by Javascript which we can use directly. 
-Userdefine function : function developer us for pecific operation.

Types of function 
1.function with no parameter and no return value.
2.function with parameter but no return value.
3.function with no parameter but with return value.
4.function with parameter and with return value. 

syntax:  function functionname(){
  //logical code 
}

*how to perform calculator with onew function
*prompt : it generate one popup window and user to insert data in it. 


Task1: take value from prompts and display wether he is your friend or not.
Task2:take value from prompts and display wether enter number is even or odd .
Task3:take value from prompts and display wether enter alphbet is vovels or consonent.
