*Javascript: 
-it is use to add functionality into webpage or webapp.
-it is interpreted language.
-it is loosely types language.


*how many ways we can use Javascript
1.internal Javascript: in this ,in html filw we use script yag and in that we write Javascript code
2.External Javascript:in thus we crteatea sepreate js file and that js file we import in html file head part script.

*How to display output in js 
1.document.write(): it will display output on browser.
2.window.alert(): it will generate one popup and display output in it.
3.console.log():it will display output in browser console.
4.DOM(Document Object Model):


Note: in Javascript window is global object 

*Variable:-it is container which store data in it.
          -store data can be change to reuse it.
          -in js we can create Variable with var ,let and const keyword.

syntax:     var variableName;   // variable declaration;
            variableName = value; // variable initialization;
              or 
            var variableName = value; // defining a variable   

*Rule For creating Variable 
-its name can not be any reserved keyword.
-variable name can not start with digit.
-variable name must start with lowercase letter.
-in Javascript variable name can start with $ and _ 

*Data type: 
*Looping Statment: to repeate same thing multiple time 
1.for loop: in this if condition is true then and only then innner code will execute.
  syntax: for(initialization;condition-check;increment/decrement){
       //logical code
  }
2.while loop:in this if condition is true then and only then innner code will execute.
   syntax:   initialization
    while(condition-check){
          //logical code;
         increment/decrement
     }
3.do while loop: in this even if condition is false then also code execute once.
syntax:  initialization;
        do{
            //logical code 
             increment/decrement
        }while(condition-check)



Task1: print 1,2,3.........20
Task2: print 1
            2
            3
            .
            .
            10
Task3: print 2,4,6....20

*Conditional: 
-if you want to execute code conditionaly for that we use it. 

1.if : this is condition is then and only then if block will execute 
2.if ..else: in this condition is true then if block will execute other else will execute
3.nested if lese : in this we can use if else inside another if else.
4.if ladder: 
5.swichcase :

*differance between == and === operators 
==  : it check only values and if it is same then return true value.
ex: 5==5 =>true
ex: 5=='5' =>true

=== : it check both value as well as datatype and if both are same then it reutn value.
5===5 =>true
5==='5' =>false

Q.why Javascript is called as loosely typed language.
-when we create a avariable in Javascript we can not determine what type type of data it contain.
untill and unless we initialize it.

Looping :it is use to repeate same thing multiple time. 
1.for loop 
2.while loop 
3.do while 

*Array:
-it is use to store multiple values with same data type.
-in array data store on index basis.
-array index always start from zero 
-array represented by []
-we can access array data outside array by writting arrayName[index]

*nested loop 
*function:-function is block of code which use to perform specific task.
          -function will execute only when we call it.
          -it can be reuse multiple time.

*Mainly we have two types of function
-Predefine function : function which is already developed by Javascript which we can use directly. 
-Userdefine function : function developer us for pecific operation.

Types of function 
1.function with no parameter and no return value.
2.function with parameter but no return value.
3.function with no parameter but with return value.
4.function with parameter and with return value. 

syntax:  function functionname(){
  //logical code 
}

*how to perform calculator with onew function
*prompt : it generate one popup window and user to insert data in it. 


Task1: take value from prompts and display wether he is your friend or not.
Task2:take value from prompts and display wether enter number is even or odd .
Task3:take value from prompts and display wether enter alphbet is vovels or consonent.

*Object:
-it is use to multiple values with different datatype.
-in object datatype data store in key and value pares formate.
-we can access object data outside object by writting objectName.keyname
-object denoted by {}

*how to access object data outside 
*how to access object inside object 
*how to access finction inside object 

*array of object.

*we saw task how to check enter data is vovel or consonent.

String: -it is collection of character.
        -in string each letter has index number, instring black space also consider as string.
        -in string index number start from zero.
        -in Javascript string is also data type. 

string method

To find string index we have three method 
1.indexOf("searching-string",position):
-it return index of first occurences of searching string.
-it will search string from left to right direction.
-if searching string is not found then it return -1 value.

2.lastIndexOf("searching-string",position):
-it return index of first occurences of searching string.
-it will search string from right to left direction.
-if searching string is not found then it return -1 value.

3.search("searching-string"):
-it return index of first occurences of searching string.
-it will search string from left to right direction.
-if searching string is not found then it return -1 value.
-it is faster than index of method.

*there are three method which return part of string from index number.
1.slice(start-index,end-index):
 -it will return part of string from main string 
 -if we pass +ve index then it search string from left to right.
 -if we pass -ve index then it search string from right to left.

2.subString(start-index,end-index):
-it will return part of string from main string 
 -if we pass +ve index then it search string from left to right.
 -it never accept -ve value.

3.subStr(start-index,total-number-of character):
-it will return part of string from main string 
 -if we pass +ve index then it search string from left to right.
 -it never accept -ve value.

4.chartAt(): it return single character avariable on searching index.

*typeof : it gives us datatype of variable
*Math : it is use to perform for arithmatic opertion 

Math.abs(): it return absolute value;
Math.ciel(): it return top most value;
Math.floor(): it return lowest most value;
Math.round(): it return lowest value if decimal point is below 5 otherwise it will return top;

Math.random(): it return us random value, it valie will greater than 0 and lesstah 1 

*How to get and display Date and time in Javascript
-to get and display date and time in Javascript for that first we have to create object of Date Class
-in Javascript date class object return data and time from browser.
syntax: creating object of data class

var objName = new Date();

*how to set date and time 
var objName = new Date(year,month,date,hours,minutes,second);

*setInterval : it call another method multiple time after perticular time interval.
Note: when we write a function inside another function as a argument we do not arite parenthesis.

*form validation : to check user enter data is correct or wrong.
-there are two was to perform form validation 
1. form validation after submit form data (onsubmit,onclick)
2. before submitting form data (onblur)

Callback function : passing a function as an argument inside another function.
Note: when we pass a function as an argument inside another function we do not write parenthesis.

*setTimeOut(): it call another method only once after perticular time interval.
*setInterval():it execute another method multiple time after perticular time internal.

*ES5 (ECMA Script-5 2009);
*trim(): it remove unwanted white space from both side of string.

IMP 
*Hoisting : it is Javascript default behavior which moves variable declaration at top.
            means we can use variable before declaration.

*differance between let var and const 

var :-it create function scope variable.
     -variable can be re-declare.
     -variable can be use before declaration. 


let : -it create block scrope varianle .
      -variable can not be re-declare.
      -variable can be use before declaration. 

const :-it create block scrope varianle .
       -while creating variable we have to initialize it with same time.
       -it value will never change on run time. 
       -variable can not be re-declare.
      -variable can be use before declaration.
